This is an implementation of the Paper(TODO) presented by Zachary Abel
at the Bridges Finland Conference Proceedings.

From the Abstract of the paper
"We introduce a versatile method for finding prime numbers that display
surprising intricate visual patterns -- hypothetically, any desired
pattern is possible, with only mild distortion. We use this method to 
locate several examples of large prime numbers that are, in and of
themselves, self-referential works of art".

* How does this work?

  We start with an image(i used grey scale images), use a dithering alogirthm
(Floyd-Steinberg dithering [1]) to approximate the image using only the allowd
10 shades of gray, and then checked the resulted number for primality. By adding
subtle noise to the portrait(randomly changing each pixel value by an
imperceptible +1% or -1%) before dithering, we generated many different
pixellations of the same image -- enough that one of them happened to be prime.(TODO)

I have used gmpy2 package[3] for testing whether the number is prime or not.
