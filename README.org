* About
This is an implementation of the Paper [1] presented by Zachary Abel
at the Bridges Finland Conference Proceedings.

From the Abstract of the paper
"We introduce a versatile method for finding prime numbers that display
surprising intricate visual patterns -- hypothetically, any desired
pattern is possible, with only mild distortion. We use this method to 
locate several examples of large prime numbers that are, in and of
themselves, self-referential works of art".

* How does this work?

We start with an grey scale image (can be tweaked to work with color images),
use a dithering alogirthm (Floyd-Steinberg dithering [2]) to approximate the image
using only the allowd 10 shades of gray, and then check the resulted number for
primality. By adding subtle noise to the portrait (randomly changing each pixel value by an
imperceptible +1% or -1%) before dithering, we generated many different
pixellations of the same image -- enough that one of them happened to be prime. [1]

_gmpy2_ package[3] is used for testing whether the number is prime or not.

* To run:

  Just run all cells in order of _PPotrait.ipynb_.
* Packages to install to run /PPotrait/ jupyter notebook:

  - To successfully install gmpy2, you need to have /libmpc-dev/ installed.
    On Ubuntu-18.04 it is simply
#+BEGIN_SRC 
apt install libmpc-dev
#+END_SRC

  - gmpy2 package

#+BEGIN_SRC python
pip3 install gmpy2
#+END_SRC

* Project Structure

  There are two files and three sub directories.

  - PPotrait.ipynb
    
    This is a jupyter notebook file. It contains the code, you need to run all the
    cells, at the end you get prime potrait of the input image.

  - README.org

  - InputImages/

    This is a directory which consists of test images.

  - Results/
    
    This directory with three sub directories.

    - Originals/

      This directory contains the image (after resizing) which were used as input images.

    - PPotraits/

      This directory contains the corresponding prime potraits of the images in Results/Originals
      directory.

    - Primenumbers/
      
      This directory contains text files of prime numbers for corresponding prime potraits found
      in the Results/PPotraits directory.

      Some text files also contains the iteration at which the prime potrait was produced.
